''' Numpy '''
'''Types of arrays 
single dimensional arrays- only one row of elements
 py doesn't support multi-dimensional arrays- has more than one row and columns'''

'''Numpy helps to work with mulidiemensional arrays
it contains a large library to perform many calculations like linear algebra funtions, fourier transforms etc
if an array is created using numpy its called n dimensional array where n is the no of rows. if n=1 then its 1-d array

import numpy as np

a=np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
print(a)
