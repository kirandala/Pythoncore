DATATYPES
python is dynamically typed programming language ,
Data types are available but not need to declare while declaring an object.
every variable we declare will be an object in python.


Python dont use data types concepts like java
    instead we can directly declare the variables without declaring their datatype
to find the data type of a variable type() funtion is used   '''
# syntax:
# a,b=10,'hello python'
# type(a)
# type(b)


# now,
#     a=10
#     type(a) # will be a int type
#     a=True
#     type(a) # will change to bool type

'''
Identifiers:

Rules:
should not start (0-9)
case sensitive
reserve words cant be used as idnetifier

If identifier starts with _ its private
if identifiers starts with __ its strongly private
Starts with __ on nth place its language defined special identifier
EG: __init this is keyword for constructor
'''

# import keyword
# print(keyword.kwlist) #R will print all the available keyword in python
