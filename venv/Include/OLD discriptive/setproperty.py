'''To create new set set function can be taken s1=set() or s1={1,2,3} or 

In Set : duplicates are not allowed,insertion order not preserved hence indexing not allowed,heterogenous elements allowed.
As insertion order is not preserved slice operations and indexing operations not possible.

# We can convert list into set:
# but if list contatins duplicate values , newly created set wont contain any duplicates

# l=[1,2,3,4]
# s=set(l)
# print(type(l)) #R<class 'list'>
